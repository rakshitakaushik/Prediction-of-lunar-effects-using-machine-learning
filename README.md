# Prediction-of-lunar-effects-using-machine-learning
In a world where data and technology are driving change, using machine learning
(ML)-based algorithms to better understand and forecast complex natural occurrences has
become vital. The aim of this study is to examine the intriguing relationship between two
distinct but connected natural occurrences: moon phenomena and bird migrations and
earthquakes. We leverage machine learning (ML) techniques like Random Forest and
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) to find patterns in big datasets that provide insights
into the relationship between lunar cycles, seismic activity, and bird migration.
